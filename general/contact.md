### Piazza

The best way to contact us is by [posting on this Piazza](https://piazza.com/berkeley/other/cs97), which is Q&A forum for connector instructors and CAs. If you have never signed up for Piazza before, you will need to do so first. With Piazza, you do not have to worry who the question should be sent to. We will make sure your post is seen by the right person and will get back to your promptly, probably in a few minutes or hours.

DSEP staff are monitoring the Piazza and will respond to all questions promptly.
