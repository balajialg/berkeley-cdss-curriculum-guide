If you are an instructor planning to teach using DataHub, review this paterial prior to the start of the semester.

Note that you do not need to sign up to use DataHub -- you can use it immediately -- however consider the following information.

## Be Proactive

Please submit support requests for software changes and resource allocations before instruction begins. This helps us to ensure that your requests can be accommodated and will not disrupt other course environments. Ideal time frames to make requests are either **before the start or during the first two weeks of the semester**. We recommend this timeline to ensure that we make minimal changes to the hub infrastructure when the courses are ongoing.

## Assignment Deadlines

Please try to schedule assignments during regular working hours so that infrastructure staff can troubleshoot hubs if something goes wrong.

## Test Assignments in Advance

Please try to test assignments and notebooks on the hub before giving them to students. This will allow time for the infra team to fix any issues you discover.

## Backup Students' Data

We recommend that you inform students to back up their data (notebooks and datasets) on their local devices before the end of the semester. We have prepared [download instructions](/workflows/download-archive) on how students can retrieve all of their archived files.  We receive a lot of student requests to retrieve their files after the completion of the semester. Any upfront communication from your end about backing up their files will hopefully ease the workload for us.

## Learn More

- If you are interested in learning more about the configuration of various Berkeley hubs, you can checkout [UC Berkeley's JupyterHubs documentation](https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu).

- If you want to set up a hub infrastructure at your end and are interested in learning more about the technical details, use this [Zero to JupyterHub with Kubernetes documentation](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

We have [over a dozen hubs](https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/hubs.html) which cater to the diverse needs of the campus audience. We have the [main hub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/), which serves multiple departments/courses across the campus. We also have separate hubs for courses such as Data 8, Data 100, Public health, etc., serving the instructional needs.
