## Workshops

We support using our hubs for workshops. For example, [D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/) uses DataHub to run its R workshops for students regularly.

Please send an email to [Eric Van Dusen](mailto:ericvd@berkeley.edu) and/or [Balaji Alwar](mailto:balajialwar@berkeley.edu) with the specific request you have in mind. 

We need to know:
- Your exact need
- Memory/CPU requirement 
- Total number of participants 
- Dataset size
- Language required

## Research Hubs

Our primary motive for the hubs is to support the teaching practices of our instructors. However, if you are interested in doing core research, we recommend contacting the team at [Research IT](https://research-it.berkeley.edu/), who may support you with your specific use-case.
