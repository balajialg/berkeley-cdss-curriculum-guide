## GitHub Issues

The best way for instructional staff to request help with DataHub is through filing a [GitHub issue](github.md).

## Slack Channel

If you have anything you'd like to discuss with the infrastructure team, please join the #ucb-datahubs channel in at [uctech.slack.com](http://uctech.slack.com/). Anyone with a berkeley.edu account can get in.

## DataHub Service Lead

Reach out to [Balaji Alwar](mailto:balajialwar@berkeley.edu) directly if there are time-sensitive issues.

## Announcements

We are trying to build a cadence by sending public announcements about feature releases or version upgrades in the upcoming months. Watch for emails from the datahub-announce list.
