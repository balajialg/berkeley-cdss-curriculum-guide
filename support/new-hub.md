title: New Hub
---

We generally prefer using our existing hubs for teaching your courses. Our guiding principles for allowing the creation of new hub are when:

- The course has a large user base
- There is a need for undergrad students to have admin access
- There is a specific technical/architectural reasons
- There is a strong institutional/strategic reason
