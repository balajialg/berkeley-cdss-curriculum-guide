## Packages

Please test your assignments for hub compatibility before the start of the semester. Check whether all the needed Python/R packages and their required versions are installed. If not, please use the [package request template](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=felder%2Cbalajialg&labels=package-request&template=package_request.yml&title=Request+python+package+X+for+class+Y) to raise a request to the infra team.  The Infra team requires at least 2 business days for a turnaround on support requests such as this.

## Elevated Privilege Access

You can use this [GitHub template](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=balajialg&labels=support&template=admin_request.yml) to request [elevated privileges](admin?highlight=admin) for course staff to troubleshoot student servers in the requested hub.

## Big Assignments / High Use times

You can share the important date(s)/time(s) for workshops/exams/assignments etc. when you expect the resource requirement to be greater than usual. We will review your request and get back to you directly about the feasibility of increasing resources. You can provide us with all the relevant information using the [calendar event scheduling template](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=felder%2Cbalajialg&labels=support&template=resourcescheduler.yml&title=Increase+compute+resources+for+Course+XXX+between+specific+date%28s%29%2Ftime%28s%29).
