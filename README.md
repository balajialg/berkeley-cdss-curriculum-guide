## What is this site and who is it for?

This site is a guide for the Data Science Education Program. The information in the guide is primarily for instructors who are or will be teaching a course in the program. However, anyone else who wants to learn more about the program, the courses, and the technology is encouraged to look through the guide.

The information is divided up into four sections: introduction, before the course, the workflow, and during the course. The first time you read through the material, we suggest going through the topics in order. If you want to learn more about a specific topic, you can use the search bar on the top right.
