# Welcome to the Connector Guide!

## What is this guide and who is it for?

The information in the guide is primarily intended for instructors who either are or will be teaching a course in the Data Science Education Program. However, anyone else who wants to learn more about the program, the courses, and the technology is encouraged to look through the guide.

## How should I use this guide?

The information is divided up into four sections: **Introduction**, **Before the Course**, **The Workflow**, and **During the Course**. The first time you read through the material, you might go through the topics in order. After the first read, you could refer back to specific sections when seeking answers to questions.
