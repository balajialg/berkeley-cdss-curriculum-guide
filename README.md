## What is this site and who is it for?

This site is a guide for the Data Science Education Program. The information in the guide is primarily for instructors who are or will be teaching a course in the program. However, anyone else who wants to learn more about the program, the courses, and the technology is encouraged to look through the guide.

The information is divided up into four sections:

* **Introduction - **Overview of connector courses, examples of previous courses, and an introduction to the technology used and the pedagogy behind it.
* **Before the Course - **Sorting out administrative course logistics, syllabus design, and staying in touch with DSEP staff.
* **The Essentials - **Complete steps in the assignment development workflow, such as creating, publishing, collecting, and grading assignments.
* **During the Course - **Miscellaneous questions you may have during the semester, such as how to troubleshoot student errors and how to install new Python packages.
