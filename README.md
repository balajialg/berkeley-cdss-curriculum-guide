## What is this guide and who is it for?

This site is a guide for the Data Science Education Program. The information in the guide is primarily for instructors who are or will be teaching a course in the program. However, anyone else who wants to learn more about the program, the courses, and the technology is encouraged to look through the guide.

## How should I use this guide?

The information is divided up into four sections: introduction, before the course, the workflow, and during the course. The first time you read through the material, we suggest going through the topics in order. After the first read, you can refer back to the guide when you have questions on a certain topic.

If you want to learn more about a specific topic, you can use the** search bar **on the top right.

## Not able to find what you are looking for?

If you still have questions or concerns that are not addressed in this guide, you can post on the [connector instructor Piazza site](https://piazza.com/berkeley/other/cs97). This site is monitored by DSEP staff and we will get back to you promptly with a response.
