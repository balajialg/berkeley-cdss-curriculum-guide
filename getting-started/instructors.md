## Units

Most connector courses are 2-unit courses that meet once per week. Class meetings are two hours and include both a lab portion and a lecture portion. Instructors decide how they want to split up two hours between lab and lecture. Some instructors choose to spend the first hour on lecture and the second on lab. Others prefer a more fluid structure and switch between lecture and lab questions throughout the two hours.

## Workload

For students, one unit of work corresponds to three hours of work. The six hours of work for a 2-unit connector can be broken down in the following way:

* 2 hours of lab/lecture
* 4 hours of outside work

## Room Scheduling

Connector courses are held on Mondays and Tuesdays in 105 Cory. Please discuss scheduling a time for your connector with Cathryn. 

## Office Hours

Instructors hold office hours for one hour each week. If you would like a space to hold your office hours, please contact Cathryn.
