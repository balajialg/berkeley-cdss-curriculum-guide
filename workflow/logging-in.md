title: Logging In
---

Most of our hubs use [bCourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu),
for authentication. The hubs not using bCourses are edx, highschool, and workshop.

## Authorization

Anyone who can log in to bCourses can log into our hubs. This includes all
Berkeley affiliates. This means if you have a working berkeley.edu email
account, you can most likely log in to our JupyterHubs.

Students have access for 9 months after they graduate. If they have
an incomplete, they have 13 months of access instead.

## Non-Berkeley affiliates

If someone who doesn't have a berkeley.edu account wants to use
the hubs, they need to obtain a [CalNet Sponsored Guest
account](https://calnetweb.berkeley.edu/calnet-departments/calnet-sponsored-guests) and get added to a bCourses course.

## bCourses and Groups

bCourses knows which courses that students and course staff are affiliated with, as well as which [ad hoc groups](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-manually-assign-students-to-groups/ta-p/663) that people have been assigned to by course staff. This information is communicated to the hubs when people login, which can be useful for [elevating the privileges](admin#obtaining-elevated-privileges) of some users or granting additional computing resources to others.

## Troubleshooting

Please contact us if you can log in to
[bCourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu) but not to any of the JupyterHubs.

Please contact [bCourses support](https://dls.berkeley.edu/services/bcourses-0)
if you can not log in to bCourses.
