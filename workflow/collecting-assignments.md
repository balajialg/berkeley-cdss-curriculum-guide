# Collecting and Grading Assignments

We recommend using OK for assignment submission and grading. More details on OK can be found below. If you choose not to use OK, you can also have students submit assignments through bCourses. With bCourses, we recommend having students submitting assignments in notebook \(`.ipynb`\) format, as opposed to PDFs, as the notebooks are fully interactive.

## OK

[OK](https://okpy.org/) is a tool that contains functionality for submitting and grading notebooks.
