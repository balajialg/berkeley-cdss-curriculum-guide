# Collecting and Grading Assignments

We recommend using [OK](https://www.gitbook.com/book/gunjanbaid/dsep-guide/edit#) for assignment submission and grading. OK is a great tool that allows students to submit notebooks by just running one cell, without having to do any uploads or downloads. More details on OK can be found below.

If you choose not to use OK, you can also have students submit assignments through bCourses. Students can download the assignments from JupyterHub in the original `.ipynb` format, or other formats such as PDF, and then upload them to bCourses.

## OK

[OK](https://okpy.org/) is a tool that contains functionality for submitting and grading notebooks. OK can be used to test code in the notebooks, submit assignments by just running one cell, and grade submissions through the online interface. OK has many advanced features that you can learn more about through their website. This guide will cover just the basics of using the system. There are two parts that you will interact with when using OK for your classes: the OK web interface at `okpy.org` and configuration files that are needed for each assignment. The web interface will be used for initial course setup, adding assignments to OK, and grading. The configuration files are needed to run tests and submit notebooks from JupyterHub.

### Initial Course Setup

To get started with OK, you must first create a course on the OK website. Go to [okpy.org](https://www.gitbook.com/book/gunjanbaid/dsep-guide/edit#), scroll to the bottom of the page, and click on the `REGISTER YOUR COURSE` button to follow the steps for creating a new course. The steps should be fairly straightforward, but as always, feel free to post on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/berkeley/other/cs97) if you run into any trouble.
