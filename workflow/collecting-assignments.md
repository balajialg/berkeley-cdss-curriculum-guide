# Collecting and Grading Assignments

We recommend using [OK](https://www.gitbook.com/book/gunjanbaid/dsep-guide/edit#) for assignment submission and grading. OK is a great tool that allows students to submit notebooks by just running one cell, without having to do any uploads or downloads. More details on OK can be found below.

If you choose not to use OK, you can also have students submit assignments through bCourses. Students can download the assignments from JupyterHub in the original `.ipynb` format, or other formats such as PDF, and then upload them to bCourses.
