# Collecting and Grading Assignments

We recommend using OK for assignment submission and grading. OK is a great tool that allows students to submit notebooks by just running one cell. If you choose not to use OK, you can also have students submit assignments through bCourses. Students can download the assignments from JupyterHub in the original `.ipynb` format, or other formats such as PDF, and then upload them to bCourses. 

## OK

[OK](https://okpy.org/) is a tool that contains functionality for submitting and grading notebooks.
