# JupyterHub

## What is JupyterHub?

Jupyter notebooks can be used in conjunction with JupyterHub. The term JupyterHub refers to the infrastructure set up on [datahub.berkeley.edu](http://datahub.berkeley.edu\). This site provides cloud-based internet storage and computation power for assignments. Instructors and students can work on and store assignments entirely through JupyterHub. No local installation of Python, Jupyter, etc. is needed. All you need is a browser to get started!

## Do you need JupterHub to use notebooks?

You don't need to use JupyterHub in order to use the Jupyter notebooks. Notebooks can be used and stored locally in your computer's filesystem. This requires some extra installation and setup that we have not provided directions for on this site. You don't need an internet connection in order to use and access the notebooks on your own computer. You do need an internet connection in order to use the \[datahub.berkeley.edu\]\([http://datahub.berkeley.edu\](http://datahub.berkeley.edu%29\) JupyterHub.

## Why does JupyterHub exist?

Working on JupyterHub ensures that all students and instructors are using the same computing environment, reducing installation or compatibility issues that come up with different computers and operating systems. In addition, the work stored over the cloud can be accessed from anywhere. Students who don't have access to a personal computer can still access their work through library computers.

## Getting Access

Anyone with a berkeley.edu email address has access to the JupyterHub at datahub.berkeley.edu. If you are having difficulties with logging in, please make sure that you are using the correct JupyterHub URL and a berkeley.edu email to login. Please post on Piazza if you are unable to solve JupyterHub access issues.
