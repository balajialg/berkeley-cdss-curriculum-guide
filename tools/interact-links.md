# Interact Links

## What are interact links?

Interact links allow you to obtain a file or folder in your personal JupyterHub account with one click. When an interact link for a particular assignment is clicked, all files for the assignment will show up in the user's personal JupyterHub account. Files do not need to be download from an external site and then uploaded back to the JupyterHub account; interact links simplify this process. 

Interact links must be used with content that is stored on a public GitHub repository. You must also specify which JupyterHub the content should be copied into. All of this information is encoded within the link. Here is the format for an interact link.

## Can I use interact links with my own GitHub repo?

Yes! Please contact us if you want to set this up. Links for repos in the \[data-8\]\([https://github.com/data-8\](https://github.com/data-8%29\) GitHub organization will work automatically, but we will need to do some setup for your personal repo.

## Can I specify branches for interact links?

Yes! This is a newly added feature, you can now pull code from a specific branch.
