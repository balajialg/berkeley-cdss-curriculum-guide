# Interact Links

## What are interact links?

Interact links are a tool developed for use with JupyterHub. These links, when clicked, will automatically down a Notebook or folder to a user's JupyterHub account. To see an example of interact links in action, try clicking on any assignment link for \[Data 8\]\(http://data8.org/sp17/\).

## Can I use interact links with my own GitHub repo?   

Yes! Please contact us if you want to set this up. Links for repos in the \[data-8\]\(https://github.com/data-8\) GitHub organization will work automatically, but we will need to do some setup for your personal repo.

## Can I specify branches for interact links?

Yes! This is a newly added feature, you can now pull code from a specific branch. 

## Interact Link Generator

Copy the URL of your assignment file or folder. Make sure you're on the desired GitHub branch when copying the link. You can paste the link to the \[link generator tool\]\(https://url-to-interact.herokuapp.com\) to automatically generate interact links for your assignments.
