# Interact Links

## What are interact links?

Interact links simplify the assignment distribution process. Rather than downloading files from an external source and then uploading to their personal JupyterHub accounts, users can obtain all files for a given assignment with just one click. When a user clicks on an interact link for a particular assignment, all files for the assignment will show up in the user's personal JupyterHub account.

## Components

Here is a brief description of the various components of an interact link, highlighted in different colors in the image. If you are new to GitHub you may want to familiarize yourself with the basics \(repositories, branches, etc.\) to better understand each component.

## Restrictions

To use an interact link, files must be stored in a public GitHub repo. Currently, interact links are only supported for certain repositories. You can either store content in one of the allowed repositories or contact us on Piazza to add your repository to the list of approved ones. In the future, we will provide automatic interact link support for all repositories.



## Can I specify branches for interact links?

Yes! This is a newly added feature, you can now pull code from a specific branch.

## Interact Link Generator

Copy the URL of your assignment file or folder. Make sure you're on the desired GitHub branch when copying the link. You can paste the link to the \[link generator tool\]\([https://url-to-interact.herokuapp.com\](https://url-to-interact.herokuapp.com%29\) to automatically generate interact links for your assignments.
