# Interact Links

## What are interact links?

Interact links simplify the assignment distribution process. Rather than downloading files from an external source and then uploading to their personal JupyterHub accounts, users can obtain all files for a given assignment with just one click. When a user clicks on an interact link for a particular assignment, all files for the assignment will show up in the user's personal JupyterHub account. Here is what an interact link looks like.

Interact links must be used with content that is stored on a public GitHub repository. You must also specify which JupyterHub the content should be copied into. All of this information is encoded within the link, as shown in the image.

## Can I use interact links with my own GitHub repo?

Yes! Please contact us if you want to set this up. Links for repos in the \[data-8\]\([https://github.com/data-8\](https://github.com/data-8%29\) GitHub organization will work automatically, but we will need to do some setup for your personal repo.

## Can I specify branches for interact links?

Yes! This is a newly added feature, you can now pull code from a specific branch.

## Interact Link Generator
