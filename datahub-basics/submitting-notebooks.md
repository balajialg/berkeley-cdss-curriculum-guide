# Submitting Notebooks

## OKpy

Under construction.

## bCourses

Students can \[download notebooks\]\(\) and submit them to bCourses. We recommend having students submit files in \`.ipynb\` format. It is difficult to view output on PDFs and content on long lines sometimes gets cut off. For notebooks that are submitted in \`.ipynb\` format, you may find \[these examples\]\(https://github.com/data-8/connector-instructors/blob/gh-pages/examples/grade\_student\_notebooks.ipynb\) from the \[\`connectortools\`\]\(https://github.com/data-8/connector-instructors/wiki/connectortools-Module\) module useful for running the notebooks.
