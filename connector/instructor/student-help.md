# Getting Student Help

There are three main roles through which students can assist with your courses. You may choose to work with students in all, none, or some of the roles. A brief description of each of the student roles is below.

### Student Developer

For new connectors, DSEP can match you with a student developer who can help create labs. These students have experience working with Python, Jupyter notebooks, and basic data science libaries. They can help with brainstorming ideas and translating them into Python code. In the past, student developers have worked with instructors over the summer or in the early weeks of the semester. The time commitments for this role will vary based on student availability and instructor need.

If you are teaching a new connector and want some additional help developing the initial content, please contact Gunjan Baid.

### Connector Associates

DSEP can match you with an undergraduate connector assistant \(CA\) who can help you throughout the semester. CAs can help with a variety of tasks such as answer questions during lab and testing assignments. All CAs are enrolled in a two unit decal course, _Teaching Data Science - Connectors_. This decal will provide them with the training needed to assist with the connectors. The decal consists of 90 hours of work for the semester, 39 hours of which will be spent on in-class training.

* 39 hours - In-class training with Aspen
* 51 hours - Connector work

  * 6 weeks x 1.5 hours of connector instructor meetings = 9 hours

  * 15 weeks x 2 hours weekly of connector course labs = 30 hours

  * 15 weeks x 1 hour weekly of lab prep = 15 hours

If you would like a CA for the semester, please contact Aspen Hsu.

### Graders/Readers

Grading is NOT the responsibility of student developers or connector associates. If you would like a paid student grader/reader, please discuss this with Ryan Edwards.
