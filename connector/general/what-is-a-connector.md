# What is a Connector Course?

Connector courses allow students to apply theoretical concepts from Data 8 to a particular area of interest. Below are some details that characterize the average 2-unit connector course. This is just to give you a general idea of what connectors are like. Some connectors may not fully match this description.

## Prerequisites

Data 8 is usually the only prerequisite. Students can take connectors at the same time as or after Data 8.

## Units

Connector courses have generally been two units in the past. There have not been any three unit connectors yet but this is a possibility if your connector is higher in workload.

## General Course Structure

* One two-hour class meeting per week, which includes both a lab and lecture portion. Instructors decide how they want to split up two hours between lab and lecture. Some instructors choose to spend the first hour on lecture and the second on lab. Others prefer a more fluid structure and switch between lecture and lab questions throughout the two hours.
* Weekly office hours
* Weekly lab
* Additional projects and/or homeworks, depending on lab length/difficulty.

## Workload

For students, one unit of work corresponds to three hours of work. The six hours of work for a 2-unit connector can be broken down in the following way:

* 2 hours of lab/lecture
* 4 hours of outside work
