title: Generate nbgitpuller link
---

This is an activity for instructors which describes two methods for generating `nbgitpuller` links..

## Via Web Browser Extension
 
- Click this [link](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fds-modules%2FDataHub-Workshop&branch=main&urlpath=tree%2FDataHub-Workshop%2Firis.ipynb) to launch a Jupyter notebook. This will clone a repository containing a Jupyter notebook to the home directory of your Berkeley Jupyterhub account.
- Execute all the cells in the "iris.ipynb" notebook which is located inside "datahub_workshop_feb24" directory
- (This is  an optional step) Add text as markdown in the notebook. For instance, you could add a header cell that says "Welcome to my first notebook!"
- (This is an optional step) Clear all the cells (this is relevant in teaching scenario).
- Download the notebook by selecting "File -> Download" option
- Login to your Github account. Incase you don't have an account, try creating a new Github account for the sake of this activity (or collaborate with someone who has a Github account)
- Create a new Github repository (If you are new to Github, check this [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories) for detailed steps to create a repository) 
- Upload the notebook to Github repository (Refer to this [documentation](pushing-to-github#using-the-web-interface) if needed)
- Install the "DataHub Link Generator" browser extension using this [link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/datahub-link-generator/lnaihiajhgbdabdnghflmjnamjkojpke?hl=en&authuser=1). Please follow the steps in the [documentation](distributing-notebooks#nbgitpuller-plugin) to make the extension visible in your browser
- Generate a new nbgitpuller link by entering the following details in the input fields and clicking the button "Copy nbgitpuller link"
"JupyterHub URL": "https://datahub.berkeley.edu/", 
"Open In": "Classic Notebook"
- Share the nbgitpuller link with another collaborator who is attending the workshop


## Via Jupyter Notebook

- Click this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/12qOYTF3JELjBuofxsC4ktLBZFt2GD1TG) to download a PDF containing python code
- Login to https://datahub.berkeley.edu/
- Launch a new notebook by selecting "Python 3 (ipykernel)" option from launcher (If required, refer to this [documentation](creating-notebooks#create-a-blank-notebook))
- Copy paste the code from the PDF to the new notebook
- Save the notebook
- Download the notebook by selecting "File -> Download" option
- Login to your Github account. Incase you don't have an account, try creating a new Github account for the sake of this activity (or collaborate with someone who has a Github account)
- Create a new Github repository (If you are new to Github, check this [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories) for detailed steps). Upload the downloaded notebook to this Github repository.
- Install the "DataHub Link Generator" browser extension using this [link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/datahub-link-generator/lnaihiajhgbdabdnghflmjnamjkojpke?hl=en&authuser=1).
