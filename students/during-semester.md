## Accessing Course Materials
**Course Hub:** Use nbgitpuller links shared by your course instructors to launch notebooks in DataHub

**Notebooks and Scripts:** Open and work on Jupyter Notebooks, R scripts, or other files as provided by your instructor.

**To manage files in JupyterHub:** To upload a file, click the "Upload" button in the JupyterHub interface and select the file from your local machine. To download a file, right-click on the file in the JupyterHub interface and select the "Download" option.

## Completing Assignments
**Regular Use:** Regularly log in to DataHub to complete assignments, run analyses, and work on projects.

**Save Work:** Save your progress frequently. It's good practice to manually save your work as well.

**Check Storage Space:** Delete unnecessary files and constantly check the storage size of the home directory.  You can do this by opening a Terminal, and executing `du -sh`

**Don’t Duplicate Shared Directory Content:** If your course work requires shared directories where instructors are storing large datasets, don’t create a copy of the files in your home directory. Always, read data from the shared directory.

**Do Your Work in Sub Directories:** Create a sub directory for each assignment and do your work there. Avoid working on assignments from the root directory as they may lead to data issues if done wrongly.

## Collaboration and Sharing

**Instructor Feedback:** Share your work with instructors or TAs for feedback by downloading and submitting your notebooks as required.
