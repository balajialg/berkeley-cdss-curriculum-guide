[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io) is "a highly extensible, feature-rich notebook authoring application and editing environment." Most courses on DataHub use JupyterLab as the primary user-facing application.

JupyterLab supports many different programming languages such as Python, R, and Julia. The languages are made available through [kernels](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/stable/projects/kernels.html). The main hub has both Python and R kernels while, Julia is available on [Julia Hub](https://julia.datahub.berkeley.edu).

Besides the built-in features, there are numerous [extensions](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/extensions.html) that can be used to augment its features.
