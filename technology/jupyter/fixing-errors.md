# Fixing JupyterHub Errors

For errors related to execution of code, such as a cell taking too long to run, you should try restarting the kernel. For errors related to login, you should try starting and stoping the server. If students are experiencing errors on JupyterHub, the first step is to try restarting their servers.

## Restarting the Kernel

## Restarting Student Servers

Those with admin rights can access the Admin tab on the DataHub control panel. Through the admin panel, any user's server can be stopped and then restarted. To access the Admin tab, first click on `Control Panel` on `datahub.berkeley.edu`.
