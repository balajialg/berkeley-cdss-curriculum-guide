title: Resources For Students
---

Students taking a course with a data science component may need extra resources in order to be successful. In this section, we provide information and links to connect students with computers and in-person help.

## Laptop Lending

- Students who need access to a computer can [borrow a Chromebook from Moffitt Library](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/data-science-chromebooks-program) for the entire semester.
- The [Student Technology Equity Program (STEP)](https://studenttech.berkeley.edu/step) provides need-based loans of technology hardware to graduate, professional and undergraduate students at UC Berkeley.
