title: Remote Desktop
---

Some GUI applications require a full desktop environment to run. Instead of
trying to get students to install software locally, we offer a full fledged
Linux desktop environment they can access from inside their browser. This is
just a different user interface with the same infrastructure. Users are
operating in their DataHub home directories.

Try remote desktop on [EECS DataHub](https://eecs.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/desktop) with a berkeley.edu account, or [on Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/yuvipanda/jupyter-desktop-server/master?urlpath=desktop) without a berkeley.edu account.
