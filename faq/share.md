**How do I spread the word about the hub?**

We are always interested in getting case studies of how differennt teaching teams used their hub and tweaked it to their needs. Reach out to Eric Van Dusen (ericvd@berkeley.edu)/Balaji Alwar (balajialwar@berkeley.edu) if you are interested to share about your experience during the past semesters!

**What are the collaterals that I can use to share the information about the hub?**

- [Data science modules](https://ds-modules.github.io/) are short explorations into data science that give students the opportunity to work hands-on with a data set relevant to their course and receive some instruction on the principles of data analysis, statistics, and computing. Here is the [link]() to DS-Modules repository which has information on the many courses using it at Berkeley. Reach out to Eric Van Dusen (ericvd@berkeley) if you want help to make notebooks.
