## Spread the Word

We are always interested in getting case studies of how different teaching teams used their hub and tweaked it according to their needs. So reach out to [Eric Van Dusen](mailto:ericvd@berkeley.edu) or [Balaji Alwar](mailto:balajialwar@berkeley.edu) if you are interested in sharing your experience using hub over the past semesters!

## Learn More

- Anyone interested to know more about Data initiatives at Berkeley, can take a look at Computing, Data Science and Society's (CDSS) [educational partners](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus/data-science-resources/educationalpartners).

- [Data science modules](https://ds-modules.github.io/) are short explorations into data science that give students the opportunity to work hands-on with a data set relevant to their course and receive some instruction on the principles of data analysis, statistics, and computing. Here is the [link](https://github.com/ds-modules) to DS-Modules repository which has information on the many courses using it at Berkeley. Reach out to Eric Van Dusen (ericvd@berkeley) if you want help to make notebooks.

- [Otter Grader]((https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/en/latest) is a light-weight, modular open-source autograder developed by the Data Science Education Program at UC Berkeley.
